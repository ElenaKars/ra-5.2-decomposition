Decomposition
===

You work for a startup that has decided to compete with Yandex itself in terms of providing content. This is, of course, a joke, but the task is serious.

They brought you a design layout similar to this:

What you need to do:

1. Break the entire interface into components and in the file of each component write literally one line of commentary, what this component is responsible for. You can use the JSDoc format, details about it can be found at [link](https://react-styleguidist.js.org/docs/documenting/). We also recommend [article](https://medium.com/@antonkrinitsyn/jsdoc-react-5e6c530880a0) on JSDoc.
2. Try to make repeating components customizable using `props`. Let's say that each news in the news list has an icon, text and a link.

There is no need to implement functionality or styling; a basic design is enough so that all the blocks are visible.
